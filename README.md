# BDDfy.Selenium.Test
Exploration of using Selenium with BDDfy and MSTest.

This project was for learning BDDfy, and using it to create tests using Selenium against a website. I have no affiliation with the website used or the organization it belongs to (although I think it is a fantastic charity based solely on viewing the website). The website is  https://www.charitywater.org/ 

I had no part in developing BDDfy or Selenium. I'm just a person interested in learning.
